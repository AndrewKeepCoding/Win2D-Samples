# Win2D samples

These sample projects show how to use the Win2D graphics API.

- **Example Gallery** is the main Win2D demo and sample application. This is a C# XAML 
  application, and contains many different examples showing various capabilities of 
  Win2D, with a menu to select between them. Start here to get an idea of what Win2D can 
  do and how use it.

    - *Example Gallery is also available in the
      [Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGGXWT9F).*

- **Composition Example** shows how to use Win2D to draw onto a Windows.UI.Composition 
  drawing surface or swapchain.

- **CoreWindow Example** is a C# application that draws directly to a CoreWindow, 
  without using XAML.

- **Simple Sample** is, yup, you guessed it! Pretty much the simplest possible app that 
  uses Win2D - it's our version of the venerable "hello world".

These samples reference the NuGet package [Win2D.uwp](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Win2D.uwp), 
which will be automatically downloaded when you build the sample, so there is no need to 
separately install Win2D itself. Win2D [source code](http://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D) 
is also available for those who like to see how the sausage is made.

An additional set of unofficial samples were created during a July 2015
[app building exercise](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/win2d/archive/2015/08/05/win2d-app-building-samples.aspx):

- [Harrydactyl: Cooper's silly game with dinosaurs](http://github.com/coopp/Harry)
- [Shawn's Terrific Universal App for photogRaph Tweaking](http://github.com/shawnhar/stuart)
- [Age and Gender Guesser](http://github.com/austinkinross/age-gender-guesser)
- [Rubik’s Cube Solver](http://github.com/austinkinross/rubiks-cube-solver) (work-in-progress)
- [SvgWin2D](http://github.com/damyanp/SvgWin2D) (work-in-progress)
